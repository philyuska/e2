        I got the idea to form the Clown Princess Entertainment Group (CPEG) after crashing into a fence while chasing a
        damn squirrel out of my yard. I knew the perfect place for it too, a hill in my town I call bunny hill.
        It's a great location, good for stalking rabbits, chasing squirrels up trees and meeting other dogs.
        I drew up plans to build a resort and casino there, but when I went to the banks to get a contruction loan, they
        all kept asking, "How did you get in here puppy dog?", so I built this web site instead. I do hope you enjoy the
        time you spend here and who knows someday when my english gets good enough to answer those bankers you may just
        see a Clown
        Princess Resort in your home town.

        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <br />
        I currently live in Winchester MA but I am originally from the mean streets of Tennessee. A nice lady
        named
        Sue
        rescued me after I showed up unprepared to a gun fight. She fixed me all up and found me a new place to
        call
        home. "God bless you Sue."

        I graduated from the K-9 East Dog Training School in 2015. I don't like cats, rabbits, squirrels or
        strangers so
        if you see me on the street, I caution against you approaching me unless you have a ham sandwich or
        something
        else good to eat.
