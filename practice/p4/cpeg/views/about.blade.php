    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I currently live in Winchester MA but I am originally from the mean streets of Tennessee. A nice lady
        named
        Sue
        rescued me after I showed up unprepared to a gun fight. She fixed me all up and found me a new place to
        call
        home. "God bless you Sue."
    </p>

    <p>
        I graduated from the K-9 East Dog Training School in 2015. I don't like cats, rabbits, squirrels or
        strangers so
        if you see me on the street, I caution against you approaching me unless you have a ham sandwich or
        something
        else good to eat.
    </p>

    <p>
        I got the idea to form the Clown Princess Entertainment Group (CPEG) after crashing into a fence chasing a dang
        squirrel varmits out of my yard.
