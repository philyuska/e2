        <h2>About Me</h2>
		
        <p>
            I currently live in Winchester MA but I am originally from the mean streets of Tennessee. A nice lady named Sue rescued me after I showed up unprepared to a gun fight. She fixed me all up and found me a new place to call home. "God bless you Sue."
		</p>

        <p>
			I graduated from the K-9 East Dog Training School in 2015. I don't like cats, rabbits, squirrels or strangers so if you see me on the street, I caution against you approaching me unless you have a ham sandwich or something else good to eat.
